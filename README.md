# FAQEstate
This web project is an attempt to create a professional portfolio using JavaScript technologies both on front-end &amp; back-end.  Starting with the static layouting using AngularJS, this is gonna be a responsive SPA (Single Page Application) having a RESTful API on top of the MEAN architecture.  Gradually, the SEO implementation &amp; other intuitive interactivities will be added in the long run.
